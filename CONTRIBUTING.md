# Froststrap Contribution

Thank you for showing interest in contributing to our project!

Here goes over mostly simple steps on how to get your patches upstream

## Know who you are

To be able to known as a contributor you need to add yourself to [.mailmap](./.mailmap).
Please make sure to read the comment in the file first.

To add yourself you do this

```
My Name <my.email@mail.server.arpa>
```

Or if you're special and have multiple emails which git might need to know you under do

```
MyName <my.email@mail.server.arpa> <my.email@mail1.server.arpa>
```

Note that the more emails you add, the more emails which will fall under your given name
at the start.

If your name is there with someone elses email, don't touch it, just add a new line with
your info, as it would make the diff easier to read.
